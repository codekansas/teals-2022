## Making a Dog do a Square

{% highlight python %}
move()
move()
turn_left()
move()
move()

# For each side of a square
for i in range(4):
    # Move forward 3 steps
    for j in range(3):
        move()
    # Turn right, by turning left three times
    for j in range(3):
        turn_left()
{% endhighlight %}

### Indentation

In Python, indentation is used to indicate what parts of the code are inside what other parts.

- Functions need to have stuff inside them, so everything inside them is indented one block
- For loops also need to have stuff inside them, so the inside of a for loop is also indented

{% highlight python %}
def turn_right_and_move():
    for i in range(3):
        # Inside the for loop
        turn_left()
    # Outside the for loop, but inside the function
    move()
# Outside the function
move()
{% endhighlight %}

## Using the For Loop Counter

In Python, the `range(...)` function just expands to a list of elements. We can check this by looking at it:

{% highlight python %}
range_elements = list(range(5))
print(range_elements)
{% endhighlight %}

Running this code will show us

{% highlight python %}
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
{% endhighlight %}

Python is a "zero-indexed" language, meaning that a for loop will always have the elements from zero to `N - 1` instead of from one to `N`.

### Summing the Elements from 1 to 100

We can write a program in Python to get the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 100 as follows:

{% highlight python %}
total_sum = 0
for i in range(100):
    # Need to change values from [0, ..., 99] to [1, ..., 100]
    number = i + 1
    # Add the number to the total sum
    total_sum = total_sum + number
print(total_sum)
{% endhighlight %}

This program prints out the value `5050`

### Trick for Calculating Long Sums

There's a story about a famous German mathematician named Carl Friedrich Gauss, when he was in school,
being given an assignment by his teacher to find the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 100. This was before
computers were around, and was supposed to just be to keep him busy. To the teacher's surprise, he was able
to answer in just a few seconds. Gauss realized there was a simple trick to be able to quickly find the
answer, without having to add up all the numbers. Consider the numbers from 1 to 10:

{% highlight python %}
   1
   2
   3
   4
   5
   6
   7
   8
   9
+ 10
----
{% endhighlight %}

Instead of writing them like this, we can write them as:

{% highlight python %}
   1   2   3   4   5
+ 10   9   8   7   6
--------------------
  11  11  11  11  11
{% endhighlight %}

When we write them this way, we make each pair of numbers add up to 11. Then the answer is clear; we just multiply
the sum of each pair by the total number of pairs (in this case, 5) to get our final answer, 55.

The same approach can be done for computing the numbers from 1 to 100:

{% highlight python %}
    1    2    3    4    5 ...
+ 100   99   98   97   96 ...
-----------------------------
  101  101  101  101  101
{% endhighlight %}

Since there are 100 numbers, there are 50 pairs; each pair adds up to 101, so the final answer is `50 * 101 = 5050`.
This is the same answer that we got using our Python program earlier.

The formal name for this is an "arithmetic series". There is an article about it [here](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArithmeticSeries.html).
