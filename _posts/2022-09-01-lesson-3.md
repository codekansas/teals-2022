## How many possible values can we represent with a binary number?

A binary number has two possible values. This means that:

- 1 binary number can represent 2 values
- 2 binary numbers can represent 4 values
- 3 binary numbers can represent 8 values
- 4 binary numbers can represent 16 values

If we have `X` binary numbers that can represent `Y` possible values, then `(X + 1)` binary numbers can represent `2 * Y` possible values. These values will be

{% highlight bash %}
0 ... original value 1
0 ... original value 2
0 ... original value 3
...

1 ... original value 1
1 ... original value 2
1 ... original value 3
...
{% endhighlight %}

In general, a sequence of length `X` can represent `2^X` possible values:

{% highlight bash %}
A binary number of length 3 can represent 2^3 = 8 possible values
A binary number of length 16 can represent 2^16 = 65,536 possible values
{% endhighlight %}

### What if we use ternary instead of binary?

Binary numbers are made up of `(0, 1)`, while *ternary* numbers are made up of `(0, 1, 2)`

If we have `X` ternary numbers, we can represent `3^X` possible values. For example, 3 ternary numbers can have the following 27 values:

{% highlight bash %}
000  100  200
001  101  201
002  102  202

010  110  210
011  111  211
012  112  212

020  120  220
021  121  221
022  122  222
{% endhighlight %}

In a computer, we use 2 instead of 3 because of how *transistors* work:

- A *transistor* is the basic building block of a computer
- It is like a light switch; it can either be on or off (so it can have two values)
- A [ternary computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_computer) is more like a stoplight; values can either be positive, negative or off (at a stoplight, this means red, yellow and green)

### Trick for quickly computing powers of 2

When trying to figure out a large power, it is tempting to do a long list of multiplications. For example, to figure out the value of `2^8` you could try:

{% highlight bash %}
2^8 = 2   * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
    = 4   * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
    = 8   * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
    = 16  * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
    = 32  * 2 * 2 * 2
    = 64  * 2 * 2
    = 128 * 2
    = 256
{% endhighlight %}

However, this takes a long time when our power gets very large. Instead, we can try computing one part of the number, then reusing that part in multiple places:

{% highlight bash %}
2^8 =  2 * 2  *  2 * 2  *  2 * 2  *  2 * 2
    = (2 * 2) * (2 * 2) * (2 * 2) * (2 * 2)
    =    4    *    4    *    4    *    4
    =   (4    *    4)   *   (4    *    4)
    =         16        *         16
    =                  256
{% endhighlight %}

This way, instead of having to do multiplication 7 times, we only have to do multiplication 3 times. This makes it much faster to compute very large powers, for example, `2^16`:

{% highlight bash %}
2^16 =  2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2  *  2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
     = (2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2) * (2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2)
     = (2^8) * (2^8)
     = 256 * 256
     = 65,536
{% endhighlight %}

## Converting from Binary to Base 10

So that other people can understand us, we decide that a binary numbers can be converted to base 10 using the following scheme:

{% highlight bash %}
0 0 0 -> 0
0 0 1 -> 1
0 1 0 -> 2
0 1 1 -> 3
1 0 0 -> 4
1 0 1 -> 5
1 1 0 -> 6
1 1 1 -> 7
{% endhighlight %}

Given an arbitrary binary number (for example, `1 1 0 1 0`), we can figure out it's base 10 representation as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
1     1     0     1     0
---------------------------
2^4 | 2^3 | 2^2 | 2^1 | 2^0
16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1

  0 * 1
  1 * 2
  0 * 4
  1 * 8
+ 1 * 16
--------
  26
{% endhighlight %}


## Converting from Base 10 to Binary

To convert back from base 10 to binary, we need to figure out which combination of 0's and 1's add up to get our base 10 number. We could try every possible combination of 0's and 1's, or we can take the following approach:

{% highlight bash %}
26

26 > 16 -> [1]
26 - 16 = 10

10 > 8 -> [1]
10 - 8 = 2

2 < 4 -> [0]

2 = 2 -> [1]
2 - 2 = 0

0 < 1 -> [0]

Binary number: 11010
