Addition and subtraction in binary and ternary

## Addition

Adding two binary numbers works in much the same way as adding two base 10 numbers. For example, try the base 10 numbers below:

{% highlight bash %}
  1 7
+ 1 9
-----
{% endhighlight %}

The usual way to do this is:

1. Add 7 and 9 to get 16
2. Since 16 is greater than 10, keep a 6 and carry the 1 to the next spot
3. Add 1 and 1 (from the original numbers) plus another 1 which was carried to get 3

{% highlight bash %}
  1
  1 7
+ 1 9
-----
  3 6
{% endhighlight %}

The same process can be done in binary. The only thing to remember is that instead of carrying the remainder if we are greater than 10, we need to carry the remainder if we are greater than 2. We also need to remember that in binary, we only have the digits 0 and 1. For example:

{% highlight bash %}
  1 0 0 0 1
+ 1 0 0 1 1
-----------
{% endhighlight %}

We can do this as follows:

1. Add 1 and 1 to get 10 (which is 2 in binary)
2. Since 10 is greater than 1, keep a 0 and carry the 1 to the next spot
3. Add 1 and 0 (from the original number) plus another 1 which was carried to get 10 (again, 2 in binary)
4. Since 10 is greater than 1, keep a 0 and carry the 1 to the next spot
5. Add 0 and 0 (from the original number) plus another 1 which was carried to get 1
6. Repeat until the end of the number

{% highlight bash %}
1     1 1
  1 0 0 0 1
+ 1 0 0 1 1
-----------
1 0 0 1 0 0
{% endhighlight %}

To double-check our answer, we can convert from binary back to base 10:

{% highlight bash %}
1 0 0 0 1   = 1 * 1 + 0 * 2 + 0 * 4 + 0 * 8 + 1 * 16
            = 1 + 16
            = 17
1 0 0 1 1   = 1 * 1 + 1 * 2 + 0 * 4 + 0 * 8 + 1 * 16
            = 1 + 2 + 16
            = 19
1 0 0 1 0 0 = 0 * 1 + 0 * 2 + 1 * 4 + 0 * 8 + 0 * 16 + 1 * 32
            = 4 + 32
            = 36
{% endhighlight %}

This is the same answer that we got for the base 10 addition earlier, so we know it's correct.

### Adding in Ternary

We can do the same process for ternary numbers, but in this case, we need to remember that we only have the digits 0, 1 and 2.

{% highlight bash %}
  1 2 2
+ 2 0 1
-------
{% endhighlight %}

We can do this as follows:

1. Add 2 and 1 to get 10 (which is 3 in ternary)
2. Since 10 is greater than 2, keep a 0 and carry the 1 to the next spot
3. Add 2 and 0 (from the original number) plus another 1 which was carried to get 10 (again, 3 in ternary)
4. Since 10 is greater than 2, keep a 0 and carry the 1 to the next spot
5. Add 1 and 2 (from the original number) plus another 1 which was carried to get 11 (which is 4 in ternary)

{% highlight bash %}
1 1 1
  1 2 2
+ 2 0 1
-------
1 1 0 0
{% endhighlight %}

To double-check our ansswer, we can convert from ternary back to base 10:

{% highlight bash %}
1 2 2   = 2 * 1 + 2 * 3 + 1 * 9
        = 2 + 6 + 9
        = 17
2 0 1   = 1 * 1 + 0 * 3 + 2 * 9
        = 1 + 18
        = 19
1 1 0 0 = 0 * 1 + 0 * 3 + 1 * 9 + 1 * 27
        = 9 + 27
        = 36
{% endhighlight %}

This is the same answer we got for the base 10 and binary additions earlier, so we know it's correct.

### Overflow

- An *overflow* occurs when our number is too big to be represented in our computer's memory.
- In a computer, binary numbers are stored in chunks of 8
  - Each binary digit is called a *bit*
  - A chunk of 8 binary digits is called a *byte*
- If our number uses more than 8 bits, but we only have 8 bits available, then we can't store it and our computer explodes. This is called an *overflow*
  - In reality, the computer doesn't explode, but it will do something incorrect. Usually this just means chopping off any bits outside of the 8 bits available

## Subtraction

Subtracting two binary numbers can be done the same way that we subtract in base 10. For example:

{% highlight bash %}
  2 2
- 1 7
-----
{% endhighlight %}

The way we do this is as follows:

1. We try to subtract 7 from 2
2. Since 7 is greater than 2, we have to borrow a 1 from the next column
3. We do 12 minus 7 to get 5
4. The next column now just has a 1, so we do 1 minus 1 to get 0

{% highlight bash %}
  1 12
- 1  7
------
  0  5
{% endhighlight %}

In binary, we can do the same process:

{% highlight bash %}
  1 0 1 1 0
- 1 0 0 0 1
-----------
{% endhighlight %}

1. We try to subtract 1 from 0
2. Since 1 is greater than 0, we have to borrow a 1 from the next column
3. We do 10 minus 1 to get 1
4. The next column now just has a 0, so we do 0 minus 0 to get 0
5. We repeat for the rest of the columns

{% highlight bash %}
  1 0 1 0 10
- 1 0 0 0  1
------------
  0 0 1 0  1
{% endhighlight %}

To double-check our answer, we can convert back to base 10:

{% highlight bash %}
1 0 1 1 0 = 0 * 1 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 4 + 0 * 8 + 1 * 16
          = 2 + 4 + 16
          = 22
1 0 0 0 1 = 1 * 1 + 0 * 2 + 0 * 4 + 0 * 8 + 1 * 16
          = 1 + 16
          = 17
0 0 1 0 1 = 1 * 1 + 0 * 2 + 1 * 4
          = 1 + 4
          = 5
{% endhighlight %}

Since this matches our answer in base 10, we know that we are correct.

### Underflow

An *underflow* happens when we do a subtraction that gives us a number that we can't represent. This could happen for two reasons:

1. If our binary representation only allows us to represent positive numbers, and our subtraction gives us a negative number
2. If our binary representation is only 8 bits, but we have a negative number that requires more than 8 bits of space

## Hacking

Overflow and underflow bugs are a common way for hackers to exploit a system. Here are some links that explain how these can be used by malicious agents to abuse systems:
